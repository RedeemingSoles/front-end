# Overview
This is a demonstration web application for the Redeeming Soles "No kids left on the sideline" 
project.  This application tracks incoming sports shoes/cleats requests from coaches and youth 
sports leagues for children who need sports shoes but the children's families do not have the 
ability to obtain the shoes.  This application also keeps an inventory of sports shoes available
to fill any requested requests in-house first.


## Getting Started
This web applications's url is [https://redeeming-soles-front.herokuapp.com/](https://redeeming-soles-front.herokuapp.com/)
Sign in and use the intuitive interface to either request shoes for your youth sports team or 
league or in Admin view allows Redeeming Soles volunteers to inventory inbound shoe donations for
 the "No Kids Left on the Sidelines" program. 

## Using This Application
A requesting coach or league official will sign up or login to the website.  Once logged in, the 
user will be able to make the needed shoe requests for their athletes.  If the user is a 
Redeeming Soles administrator, the site will be directed to the admin screen which will allow the
 user to add donated shoes into the "No Kids Left on the Sidelines" shoe inventory.
